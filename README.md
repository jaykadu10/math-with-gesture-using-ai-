1. The project aims to create a 'Math Gesture Program' that uses hand gestures to interact with an AI model 
to solve mathematical problems. 
2. The concept involves detecting hand gestures and using them to initiate actions, such as drawing a 
mathematical problem for the AI to solve. 
3. The video demonstrates using 'CV Zone' for hand detection and 'Google Gemini' as the AI model to 
interpret the drawings and provide solutions. 
4. The development process is broken down into parts: hand detection, drawing, sending data to the AI model, 
and creating an interactive app. 
5. For the drawing aspect, the script explains creating a canvas to overlay on the webcam feed and drawing 
lines based on hand movements.
